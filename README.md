# erdos.redis-mapper

A data mapper library for Redis + Clojure.

## Usage

First of all, clone the repo and install the library as a maven artifact.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/erdos/erdos.redis-mapper.git && cd erdos.redis-mapper && lein install
```

You need to import it as a dependency to use from Clojure projects.
If you use Leiningen, add the following to the `:dependencies` section of your `project.clj` file.

``` clojure
:depnendencies [...
                [erdos.redis-mapper "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]
                ...]
```

To use the library from a Clojure namespace, first, require the library.

```
(require '[erdos.redis-mapper :refer :all])
```

Second, define a schema and a validator function for your model. You can use **prismatic schema** for this purpose.

```
(def User
  {:name          String
   sc/Keyword     sc/Any})

(def user-validator (partial sc/validate User)
```

Next, define the model.

```
(db/defmodel user :validator (partial sc/validate User))
```

This generates the following functions:

- `->user` for creating new user instances and validating it.
- `->user!` for creating new user instances, validate then persist.
- `get-user` to query user instances by id or indices.

### Creating and persisting

Create a new `user` instance and save it to the db instantly:

```
(def user-1 (->user! {:name "Mark"}))
```

Now `user-1` is just an immutable Clojure map. Try to modify it and persist immediately.

```
(def user-1-modified (persist! (assoc user-1 :name "Mark-1")))
```

This saves the user to the database overriding the previous snapshot.

### Reverting

Call the `(revert x)` function on a changed map to revert it to the original version found in the db.

```
(-> user-1-modified
    (assoc :x 2314)
    (assoc :name "Change")
    ;; ... ok, here i change my mind, i want the original back
    (revert)
    (= user-1-modified)) ;; => true
```

You can always revert to the latest version persisted to the db.

### Identifier and lookup

You can get the identifier of an already persisted entity using the `->id` function.

```
(println (->id user-1-modified)) ;;  this will print an integer
```

Use the identifier value to retrieve an entity later:

```
(get-user (->id user-1-modified)) ;; return the user object from the db
```

### Indices

To use indexed values, specify the list of indices during the definition of the model.

```
(db/defmodel car :indices [:color :brand])
```

To return a sequence of all the red cars just type:

```
(get-car :color "red")
```

If the indexed key is missing from the object it will not be inserted into the index structure.
If the key is present but has a `nil` value then the `nil` value will be indexed.

```
(->car! {:color nil})
(->car! {:name "beetle"})
(count (get-car :color nil)) ;; == 1 because only the first one is indexed
```


# Development

- Use Leiningen (>2.0.0) for development.
- Call `$ lein test` to run all unit tests.
- Call `$ lein quickie` for continuous live testing.
