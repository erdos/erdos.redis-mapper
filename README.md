# erdos.redis-mapper

A data mapper library for Redis + Clojure.

## Usage

First, import the library.

```
(require '[erdos.redis-mapper :refer :all])
```

Second, define a schema and a validator function for your model. You can use *prismatic schema* for this purpose.

```
(def User
  {:name          String
   sc/Keyword     sc/Any})

(def user-validator (partial sc/validate User)
```

Next, define the model.

```
(db/defmodel user :validator (partial sc/validate User))
```

This generates the following functions:

- `->user` for creating new user instances and validating it.
- `->user!` for creating new user instances, validate then persist.
- `get-user` to query user instances by id.

### Creating and persisting

Create a new `user` instance and save it to the db instantly.

```
(def user-1 (->user! {:name "Mark"}))
```

Now `user-1` is just an immutable Clojure map. Try to modify it and persist immediately.

```
(def user-1-modified (persist! (assoc user-1 :name "Mark-1")))
```

This saves the user to the database overriding the previous snapshot.

### Reverting

Call the `(revert x)` function on a changed map to revert it to the original version found in the db.

```
(-> user-1-modified
    (assoc :x 2314)
    (assoc :name "Change")
    ;; ... ok, here i change my mind, i want the original back
    (revert)
    (= user-1-modified)) ;; => true
```

You can always revert to the latest version persisted to the db.

### Indices

```
(db/defmodel car :indices [:color :brand])
```

To return a sequence of all the red cars just type:
```
(get-car :color "red")
```
